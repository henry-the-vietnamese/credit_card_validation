# General Description.
Use Hans Peter Luhn's algorithm to validate a credit card number.

# Detailed Description.
Chances are you have a credit card in your wallet or purse. Credit card numbers
have a 'checksum' built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least
one number and the others. The checksum enables a computer to detect typos, if
not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database (which can be slow).
Most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn, a scientist who worked
for IBM. According to Luhn's algorithm, this program will validate if a credit
card number is valid ---> [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)]
